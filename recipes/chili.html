  <p>Chili is one of my favorite staples. It's super great to make in large quantities and freeze for lazy meals. I like to put lots of cheese in mine and use dark kidney beans. Here's my go-to recipe:</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 lbs ground beef</li>
  <li>2 yellow onions</li>
  <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
  <li>3 large jalape√±o peppers</li>
  <li>3 serano peppers OR 2-3 habaneros</li>
  <li>2 cans diced tomatoes</li>
  <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
  <li>3 cans dark kidney beans</li>
  <li>1/4 cup chili powder</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>dice up onions, peppers and cloves</li>
  <li>brown the meat</li>
  <li>put all everything in crock pot</li>
  <li>let cook for several (8-10) hours</li>
  <li>you have a bunch of chili, it's great!</li>
</ol>
