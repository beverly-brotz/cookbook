  <h1>Meatloaf</h1>
  <img src="" alt=""></img>
  <p>I used to hate meatloaf growing up. But I have discovered that the only reason for this was that my mom made the worst meatloaf ever. I'm pretty sure it consisted purely of stale bread, ketchup and meat. I prefer to use seasonings and this so that it actually tastes good! Here's how I make it:</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 lbs ground beef</li>
    <li>1 med onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>3 Tbsp ketchup</li>
    <li>1 tbsp worctershire</li>
    <li>3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°F</li>
    <li>mix up all the ingredients, keeping the sauce separate. You can put it in a bowl and use a masher, your hands, or put it in a bag and knead it. However you go about it is up to you.</li>
    <li>bake for 40 minutes</li>
    <li>take it out and spread the sauce out over the top</li>
    <li>bake an additional 15-20 minutes, or until internal temp reaches 160°F</li>
    <li>cool 10 minutes before slicing and serving</li>
  </ol>
